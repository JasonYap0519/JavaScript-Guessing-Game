# JavaScript-Guessing-Game
A guessing game project that was built using <strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>HTML/CSS</strong> for presenting visuals. It was also another project
that I learned how to build during my Javascript learning journey. Game instructions are shown below.

Instructions: <br>
This game requires players to guess the correct number between 1 to 20 in order to win the game. The game ends when the player guesses the correct number, 
otherwise hints will be given each time the player guesses wrong. A score will be given based on how many times the player guesses the correct number.
